# Sample Content for Shopkit

Use these sample content files to populate a fresh [Shopkit](https://github.com/samnabi/shopkit). These categories and products will be updated periodically to reflect new features.

## Installation

First, install [Shopkit](https://github.com/samnabi/shopkit).

Then, copy this repo's content into `site/content/1-shop/`. Unfortunately, you can't use `git clone` because `1-shop/` is a non-empty directory.
